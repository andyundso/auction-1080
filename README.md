# Auction 1080

In November 2019, I wanted one of those fancy new NVIDIA graphic cards with ray tracing. I bought a 2070 in the end, which, in hindsight, wasn't worth it. I created this little application to auction out my old 1080 between my friends.

The data is stored in Firebase, the UI allows to place bets (without authentication) and updates every minutes to take into account that people place bets at the same time.

The app was originally hosted on Heroku, but since free dynos get removed per 28th of November, I deleted the app and archive this project to Github.
